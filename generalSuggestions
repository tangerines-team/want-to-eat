I have one more suggestion, about our project.

I think it would be not bad if we create one more git branch. For example, "dev" branch, and will work with this
branch and in "master" brunch we well merge only "build" files. We can push to master branch every two days, or daily,
or weekly, or when we'll need this.

But we can do it a bit later, after listening a presentation about SCM.
