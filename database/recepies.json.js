You'll find you can mix and match quite a bit, according to what's in your pantry. If you want to use rice, you can add a bit of extra liquid (one empty soup can should do it) and cook the rice right in the baking pan. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the rice is tender. If you want to use pasta, cook it first, but undercook it a little, since it will soak up some liquids from the sauce. In a pinch, you can also cook pasta during the baking, using liquids in the casserole, but the consistency will be a bit off.",
