Ihor asked us to give him a list of technologies, which we want to use in our project.
Let's write some suggestions with technologies, you think will be suitable for our project, below.

For example:

Vira {
    I'd like to use sass for styling our components.
    And I also think it would be good practise to use native js, not JQuery and plugins, but if we will need some plugins
    later, it also would not very bad.

    And what about grunt? I'd like to use it... We can practice in configuring grunt and git(locally, because it would be
    bad if we'll commit all node modules to git repository, we should install all grunt modules in '--save dev' mode and
    push only package.json file to github).
}

Volodya {
	Actually I don't care what technologies to use. Everything what do you need - will I use.
	I just have a proposal to not use a lot of technologies, because in our project we don't need that, and that may make a exstra problems.
	I propose just to use native code.
	I support to use SASS here.. if I understand right it's nothing over-complicated there.
	I hope we can get used it for a day and it will be more better to work with SASS.
