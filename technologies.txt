Ihor asked us to give him a list of technologies, which we want to use in our project.
Let's write some suggestions with technologies, you think will be suitable for our project, below.

For example:

I'd like to use sass for styling our components.
And I also think it would be good practise to use native js, not JQuery and plugins, but if we will need some plugins
later, it also would not very bad.


Volodya {
	Actually I don't care what technologies to use. Everything what do you need - will I use.
	I just have a proposal to not use a lot of technologies, because in our project we don't need that, and that may make a exstra problems.
	I propose just to use native code.
	I support to use SASS here.. if I understand right it's nothing over-complicated there.
	I hope we can get used it for a day and it will be more better to work with SASS.
